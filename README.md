The Guessing Game is a Python game where players guess a randomly selected 5-letter word. Players have a limited number of guesses and receive feedback on their guesses.

How to Run:

Place a text file named Words.txt in the same directory as game.py
Run the game:
Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

You have 5 guesses to figure out the word.
After each guess, you get feedback:
Correct letters in the right positions.
Correct letters in wrong positions marked with underscores (_).
Incorrect letters also marked with underscores (_).

The game ends when you run out of guesses or guess the word correctly.
Ensure the Words.txt file contains only 5-letter words.
